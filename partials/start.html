		<p>Welcome to Cinema Tycoon!</p>
		<p>As an up-and-coming entrepreneur and aficionado of the silver screen, you've recently leased a chunk of mall real-estate for the purpose of running a movie theater.</p>
		<p>One day, if you play your cards right, you could even produce your <i>own</i> films.</p>
		<p>Whether you play it fast and loose, or cautiously slow, your ultimate goal is to turn your seed money into a million dollars. Do that, and you've won. Drop more than $1,000 in debt and the landowner will pull your lease.</p>

If you have $1,000,000 in the bank at the end of a given business week, and have produced at least three films, then you have won the game. But, beware: You must accomplish this goal before the conclusion of your third year.</span></div>

Whether it's your employees tired of late paychecks, past due bills on your leases, or bank repossession on you purchased equipment, if you drop below -$10,000 you lose it all.</span></div>

Day, Week, and Year are calculated as you'd expect (7 days in a week, 365 days in a year, etc.). Seasons, however, change exactly every 90 days and have a direct impact on how popular some movies are at a given moment.</span></div>

The price of a ticket severely affects a patron's interest in entering the theater. At a certain point, a price too high could ensure almost no one will buy one. A price too low and you'll go bankrupt in no time.</span></div>

It's expensive, and each improvement costs more in construction loan interest. Make sure you have enough seats in your theater to justify this improvement.</span></div>

This improvement is directly dependent on patrons entering your theater. If zero ticekts are sold, then no snacks can be purchased. More people, means more snack revenue. Beware! Like most improvements, each machine that makes each snack is leased at an increasingly higher amount (but earns more as well). Make sure you have the patrons to justify having these snacks.</span></div>

This improvement is directly dependent on patrons entering your theater. If zero ticekts are sold, then no games can be played. More people, means more games revenue. Beware! Like most improvements, each arcade machine is leased at an increasingly higher amount (but earns more as well). Make sure you have the patrons to justify having these games.</span></div>

Not enough employees and your cinema will look run down and dirty. More than enough and it will look like a shining beacon of entertainment. More employees equals more tickets sold. Less employees means...well...less tickets sold. To hire or fire employees, go to the "Office" module.</span></div>

Each one costs more than the last as a weekly expense, so make sure you have the seats available to make it worth the while.</span></div>

Since nothing is free, you must purchase licenses from production companies. Each movie has optimal seasons and terrible seasons in which to be played. They have expected popularity, which is accurate "some" of the time. The cost of the lease is how much expense accrues each week from having it. Lastly, the length of lease is how many weeks the lease will last. After that, it expires, and is removed from your collection of movies. To purchase new movie licenses, go to the "Office" module. To look at leases already owned, check them out in one of your "Salons."</span></div>

It is even one of the requisites for winning the game. To produce a movie, go to the "Workshop" module and select the option. It will cost a small fortune, so make sure to do it only when you're financially ready.</span></div>
		<div class="row"><span class="col-lg-9 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-9 col-md-offset-3 col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-7 col-xs-offset-5">A movie produced will allow a title, synopsis, optimal season, worst season, lease cost, and lease duration to be chosen by you, the producer. Popularity is chosen at random. Once made, your movie is stored in the database and licenses for it can be purchased by other users, playing other instances of Cinema Tycoon.</span></div>

Seats can be purchased within that range at a fixed cost for each. Don't worry, additional seats don't equal additional expense. Keep in mind, you can't sell more tickets than you have seats. Therefore, your total seat number directly correlates to your maximum number of tickets sold that day.</span></div>

Increasing these costs money up-front, but has no weekly expense attached. It will improve the odds that patrons will want to purchase tickets for the movie playing in that salon.</span></div>

This can be altered at any time, but must have the movie licenses available. A salon with no movie playing will sell no tickets.</span></div>

There is an upfront construction cost and a weekly expense for land leases, loans on construction costs, etc.. It would be wise not to build additional salons until you have maximized the seats in your existing salons.</span></div>
