# Cinema Tycoon
(In Progress) - A simple (Rollercoaster Tycoon styled) resource management game using AngularJS

## User takes over a movie theater, and must make it thrive.

## A Theater has a number of salons (viewing rooms), each containing various upgrades, additonal rooms, emplyees, custom movies (titles and synopsis), promotions, etc.

## Upgrades and purchases to the theater (arcade games, snacks, parking spaces, etc.) provide additional income.

## Random events give user choices to make that can either benefit or hurt player's income.

## To complete the eventual C.R.U.D. capability, user will be able to "produce" movies, giving them titles, and synopsis of their choice that other players will see in their gameplay. Additional money spent will allow user to increase "Quality" of the movie, which increases ticket sales when playing it. Also, they can choose the optimal season for the movie; a fact normally hidden from the user.
